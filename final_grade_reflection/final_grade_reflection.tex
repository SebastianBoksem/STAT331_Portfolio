After taking into account the first six weeks of my STATS 331, I would
consider giving myself a grade of an A-. I think this decision stems
from the result in my ability to try and full learn the learning targets
attached, and as a result follow in other aspects of learning such as
revising my thinking and being collaborative in my group, peer reviews,
and Discord. Over these last 6 weeks, I feel like I have ended up being
able to successfully checkoff most learning targets. For example, with
working with data, I have successfully been able to filter rows from a
data base for a variety of data types. I think a clear example of this
lies in my Lab 3 submission, Hip-Hop. Under the Finding Beiber question,
I was able to find a single participant out of 10752 rows by different
uses of grouping and filtering both factor and numbers. Not only this,
in the process of filtering these factor variables, I needed to turn
them into factors originally, which was accomplished and done in a
program efficiency way. Instead of creating a mutate with changing the
variable to a factor for all the variables I needed to do, I instead
followed to create conciser code by including an across function (and
did in the labs that followed). I feel like I also accomplished parts of
working with data by the use of different joins, as well as filtering
joins inside more specifically my Lab 4: Avocado Prices. In this lab, A
key factor was the use of filtering joins to remove certain aspects of
regions that were not needed. My ability to filter out certain regions
has clearly been shown in the clean\_avocado data set, which I was able
to remove rows that were not connected to any metro area (and following
create new data sets surrounding US total in addition to California
regions) As a result of this, I was further able to analyze and make
visualizations about their respective Avocados sales. I believe this
also demonstrates my ability to be able to cycle between the use of
filtering joins and a filter() statement. These use of working with data
through the use of joins also connects to the learning targets
associated with Data Visualization and Summarization. In Lab4
surrounding the mean average price for different regions within
California, I calculated numerical summaries of variables, then
following that, I further used a left join to connect back to the
initial data after grouping to create different visualizations such as a
box plot. I feel like this highlights my abilities to creates these
summaries, while also highlighting my ability to differentiate between
what kind of joins exists and use each one in their own unique way. To
highlight my creative ability in creating these data visualizations, I
feel like a good example could stem from the Lab 4 challenge problem in
which we were attempting to connect each California Region's housing
prices to the average price of an avocado. I ended up creating a scatter
plot showcasing the differences and found a slight association that as
housing prices increases so did the price of avocados.
