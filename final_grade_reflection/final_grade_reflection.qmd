After looking over the last 10 weeks of this course discussion of my midterm portfolio, I would consider giving myself a grade of an A. I think this decision stems from my ability to successfully learn the targets that we were given throughout the quarter. I would say this class has took me on a journey to learn some of the most difficult, yet at the same time rewarding material than any other course I have taken. I think as a result, I have grown in aspects such as revising my thinking and being more collaborative.

I would like to think that I have accomplished most if not all of the learning targets throughout this quarter. I have accomplished WD-1 in Labs 3, 4, and 7 through the use of a CSV file and referencing it through my imports in the first step of every lab (Importing Data section). I have also achieved importing xlsx files through PracticeActivityWeek4 with the readxl package. I have accomplished WD-2 through Practice Activity 3 in step 1 in which I narrowed the data set down to certain variables. I have accomplished WD-3 in the "Finding Bieber" section of Lab 3. Here, I filtered rows from both numeric and character data types. I accomplished WD-4 in Lab 3 in question 4 by changing multiple variables to a factor type. Furthermore in question 6, I created a new variable to determine whether the participant was white or non-white. I completed WD-5 through the use of a left join on question 6 on Lab 4 to connect the different types of regions/types of avocado combinations with the original volume from the cleaned avocado data. I have achieved WD-6 through question 2 (cleaning data) in Lab4 by incorporating both anti-joins to remove total_us rows and also semi-joins to only list California cities. I have completed WD-7 by pivoting in Lab9 "Pennsylvania Values" section with a pivot wider. In Lab4 question 7 I used a Pivot Longer. I have accomplished R-1 through the use of my Lab8.html in which the final lab report is looking professional looking with different headers, and also being reproducible with the indication of the read.cvs being through a dropbox link. I have successfully done R-2 in PracticeActivity4, code chunk 1. For the result, I added \# before every step to signal what I did for documentation. It is also tidy is respect to using proper returns and spacing. I have achieved R-3 in the "Familiar Words" section by slicing_max to avoid any changes in inputs. I have also created achieved this in Lab7Complete in the "Adding Stops" section by creating a function that will stop if the variables are not the correct type, or the length is greater than a certain amount. I achieved DVS-1 on question 7 of Lab5 question 1 and 2 in which I made a time series plot (catagorical, numeric). I also visualized two numeric variables with a density plot in Lab2Challenge under the "Inspecting the Data" section. For Lab7 under the "Performing a More Difficult Test", I created two histograms which is one categorical variable. I completed DVS-2 in Lab 5, Question 2.3 in which I reordered the legend so that the first one would have the highest mean, connecting it better to the line graph. I have accomplished DVS-3 in Lab7 in the "Visualizing Missing Data" section in which I make a time graph upon which entries were marked as NA. I completed DVS-4 to find numerical summaries in Lab 3 in the "Familiar Words" section in which I found a medians of different ratings. I have completed DVS-5 in Lab7 in which I summarized (a count) across every single variable the number of NA values in each. I have accomplished DVS-6 on Lab9 in the "Pennsylvania Values" section in which I created a table for the counts between the two states. I achieved DVS-7 in Lab9Challenge "Importing Data Set" section in which I added a filter at the bottom for the reader to select in addition to making the table red. I have achieved PE-1 in Lab 3 question 4 by using a across function to mutate variables into a factor data type. I completed PE-2 in Lab7 "Writing a Function" section by creating a resealing function to re scale the length in the fish data set. I have achieved PE-3 in Lab 8 "Full Song" section by creating an an iteration with map_chr to sing the full 12 days of Christmas song. I checked off PE-4 in Lab3 question 4 by included again a across function instead of something that has been superseded like do(). I achieved DSM-1 in PracticeActivityWeek9 in which I created random uniform, normal, and chi squared distributions for instruments. Lastly, I completed DSM-2 in Lab9 by fitting a linear regression in the the name Allison over time in "Modeling the Number of Allisons" section. in the same section I also created summary statistics for the regression and plotted the residuals.

Outside of the learning targets, I feel like I have great progress throughout the quarter in terms of how I was doing. I have completed every Lab and Lab challenged that was given and received a check mark on the assignment. This class has overall been great in terms of teamwork for me. My team have done a really influential job attempting to try and complete the practice assignments and if one of us ever has any questions about labs we tend to answer and try to help one another after class hours. As a result, I have not been absent for a single day, I think overall stemming as a motive that I enjoy and look forward to collaborating with my team. For peer reviews, I have reviewed and given helpful syntax suggestions to every person I have been assigned to, although I will say at certain times it can be hard due to us having the same coding knowledge as one another, and also small things as the graph not able to be seen can kind of make it harder to provide criticism on it. I have attempted to be more active in the Discord server. As from the last reflection, I provided an example in which a person had a question concerning how to reference a non-syntactically correct column. I previously spent the last 30 minutes looking into how to solve issues like that, and seeing there question arose I told them that back ticks were needed for certain columns like that. In addition, I also just used the code that they had (even though my code for the problem was different) and adjusting it with the back ticks to actually see if it contained the correct answer for them. I think this was important as rather then just copying and pasting my own code, it allowed them to use that small knowledge gained from me to get closer to the answer to the problem on there own. Since then, I have started to me more interactive on the questions-side of discord and asked some inquiries for my Practice Activity before the lab in which we sang a song for the twelve days of Christmas. I think doing this overall highlighted to me the importance of discord because I was able to get the question solved and coded before the start of class in which we used the same practice activity for the lab so it was needed. I also one I attempted to extend my learning by looking at more resources on the canvas page. One notable one that I mentioned in my other essay was the "From Data to Viz". This resource was something that after I figured out, I held it closely by my side for every single future lab I did. One clear Example of this is the "visualization of missing values" in Lab7. Here, I was initially lost because there was so many directions for it. However, I think using this guide often provides a simple roadmap for the different variables and how I can visualize them, and as a result I was able to accomplish the task.

However, I do also believe there are some things that could negatively affect my grade. Between weeks 5 and 7 I found my self a little often burnt out during the week and as a result some of my Practice activities ended up being missing for a few days until before I started the labs. I think towards the end of the quarter I got a grasp and turned everything in on time. In addition, there are some random assignments scattered throughout this quarter in which I turned in slightly late. I think overall this class has been the hardest, yet most rewarding classes I have ever taken. However, at the start of the quarter I set myself with a goal of simply learning R and I believe I have over achieved that immensely.
