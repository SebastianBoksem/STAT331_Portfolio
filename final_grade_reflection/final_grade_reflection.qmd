After taking into account the first six weeks of my STATS 331, I would consider giving myself a grade of an A-. I think this decision stems from my ability to try and fully learn the targets attached,. As a result, I think my learning has followed in other aspects such as revising my thinking and being collaborative in my group, peer reviews, and Discord. Over these last 6 weeks, I feel like I have ended up being able to successfully checkoff most learning targets. For example, with working with data, I have successfully been able to filter rows from a data base for a variety of data types. I think a clear example of this lies in my Lab 3 submission, Hip-Hop. Under the Finding Bieber question, I was able to find a single participant out of 10752 rows by different uses of grouping and filtering both factor and numbers. Not only this, in the process of filtering these factor variables, I needed to turn them into factors originally, which was accomplished and done in a program efficiency way. Instead of creating a mutate with changing the variable to a factor for all the variables I needed to do, I instead followed to create conciser code by including an across function (and did that in the labs that followed). I feel like I also accomplished parts of "Working with Data" by the use of different joins, as well as filtering joins inside more specifically my Lab 4: Avocado Prices. In this lab, A key factor was the use of filtering joins to remove certain aspects of regions that were not needed. My ability to filter out certain regions has clearly been shown in the clean_avocado data set, which I was able to remove rows that were not connected to any metro area (and following create new data sets surrounding US total in addition to California regions) As a result of this, I was further able to analyze and make visualizations about their respective Avocados sales. I believe this also demonstrates my ability to be able to cycle between the use of filtering joins and a filter() statement. These use of working with data through the use of joins also connects to the learning targets associated with "Data Visualization and Summarization". In Lab4 surrounding the mean average price for different regions within California, I calculated numerical summaries of variables, then following that, I further used a left join to connect back to the initial data after grouping to create different visualizations such as a box plot. I feel like this highlights my abilities to creates these summaries, while also highlighting my ability to differentiate between what kind of joins exists and use each one in their own unique way.

I have completed all the challenge assignments to date in order to highlight my creative ability in creating these data visualizations. I feel like a good example in which outside learning was used could stem from the Lab 4 challenge problem in which we were attempting to connect each California Region's housing prices to the average price of an avocado. I ended up creating a scatter plot showcasing the differences and found a slight association that as housing prices increases so did the price of avocados. This helped me overall extend my learning outside this class by being able to create a data set of my own from outside resources which previously I did not really know how to do.

Historically, I have completed every reflection attempt given the opportunity and have received check marks on all labs and challenge assignments, just waiting on a formatting reflection on Lab4. This class has overall been great in terms of teamwork for me. My team have done a really influential job attempting to try and complete the practice assignments and if one of us ever has any questions about labs we tend to answer and try to help one another after class hours. For peer reviews, I have reviewed and given helpful syntax suggestions to every person I have been assigned to, although I will say at certain times it can be hard due to us having the same coding knowledge as one another. I have started to be more active in Discord to answer questions. One example of this was during Lab4: Avocado Prices in which a person had a question concerning how to reference a non-syntactically correct column. I previously spent the last 30 minutes looking into how to solve issues like that, and seeing there question arose I told them that back ticks were needed for certain columns like that. In addition, I also just used the code that they had (even though my code for the problem was different) and adjusting it with the back ticks to actually see if it contained the correct answer for them. I think this was important as rather then just copying and pasting my own code, it allowed them to use that small knowledge gained from me to get closer to the answer to the problem on there own.

One thing I believe that would negatively affect my grade and would note for improvement over these next three weeks is my ability to answer the practice assignments on time. To my knowledge, I believe I have turned in two practice assignments later than when they were suppose to be due. To be honest, I think a small part of it has to be wanting to give myself a small break throughout the week whereas the the weekend and start of the week I would be working on the labs, challenge assignments, and the preview activities immensly. As a result, I found my self a little burnt out and waited until the weekend to complete these activities before the lab work. This is something I hope to improve on in the last part of the quarter and have started to designate times on Wednesday to complete the assignments. This class has been one of the most challenging, but at the same time rewarding classes I have taken. A goal I had from the start of the quarter was to understand R in a greater ability than I did in previous classes. I think as of now I have accomplished that immensely and hope to continue to do so until the end of the quarter!
